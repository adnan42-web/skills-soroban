## Leads

_Vulnerability trails with concrete code smells where the full exploit path could not be completed in one analysis pass. These are high-signal leads for manual review. Not scored._

- **<Title>** — `Contract.function_name` — Code smells: <missing auth, unsafe arithmetic, stale storage, etc.> — <1-2 sentence description>
- **<Title>** — `Contract.function_name` — Code smells: <...> — <1-2 sentence description>

**Rules:** Follow the template above exactly. Sort findings by confidence (highest first). Findings below the threshold get a description but no **Fix** block. Draft findings directly in report format — do not re-generate.
